# NoSpawner

A simple Spigot plugin to prevent mobs from spawning from spawners. 

This plugin is extremely basic, I just saw someone was looking for something like this, so I created it.

## Sample config:

```
NoSpawner:
   Prefix: '[NoSpawner]'
   disabled-worlds:
   - world
   - world_nether
```
   
## Compile the plugin:
  1. clone the repo into an emtpy directory
  2. cd into that directory
  3. run `mvn package`
